# UN OpenGIS: Introduction to PostGIS

This is the repository for the UN OpenGIS PostGIS training material and will be used for training UN staff within Spiral 2 of the UN OpenGIS innitiative. This material has been developed as part of the [UNOSGEO Challenge 2019](https://www.osgeo.org/foundation-news/2019-osgeo-un-committee-educational-challenge/).

The material is stored in the 'postgis-workshop-2020' folder and can be used as a HTML website or a PDF document.

In order to build the website, run the script with the following command: `perl build_script/build_html_common_git.pl`

The directories set in the script should be updated to the path in your computer before running the command. The site will be created in htdocs, navigate through it by opening index.html with your favourite browser.

For pdf output, the script will output the latex source which can then be zipped and uploaded to overleaf to obtain the document.
